Domain: Urban Transportation Analytics & Predictive Modeling

By: Sathish kumar

Slide 2 – Skills Takeaway
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)

Feature Engineering

Regression Model Building & Evaluation

Hyperparameter Tuning

Streamlit Deployment

Slide 3 – Problem Statement
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate taxi fares.

Context: Real-world urban mobility analytics.

Goal: Pricing transparency & better fare estimation for passengers.

Slide 4 – Real World Use Cases
Ride-hailing services (pre-ride fare estimate)

Driver incentive systems (optimal locations & times)

Urban mobility analytics (fare trends & demand patterns)

Travel budget planners (tourists, commuters)

Taxi sharing apps (dynamic pricing)

Slide 5 – Problem Type

Slide 7 – Feature Engineering Ideas
Trip distance (Haversine formula)

Pickup day (weekday/weekend)

AM/PM flag

Night-time flag

Convert UTC → EDT

Derived columns for deeper insights

Slide 8 – EDA
Fare vs Distance, Passenger Count

Time-based analysis (weekdays vs weekends, hourly patterns)

Outlier detection (fare, distance, duration)

Visualizations for demand patterns

Slide 9 – Data Transformation
Handle outliers (Z-score/IQR)

Fix skewness (log, sqrt, Box-Cox)

Encode categorical variables

Slide 10 – Feature Selection
Correlation Analysis

Chi-Square Test (categorical vars)

Random Forest feature importance

Remove multicollinearity

Slide 11 – Model Building & Evaluation
Models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

Metrics: R², MSE, RMSE, MAE

Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV

Slide 12 – Deployment
Save best model (pickle)

Build Streamlit UI:

User inputs → Predict total fare

Interactive & user-friendly

Slide 13 – Column Descriptions (Table Format)
Example: VendorID → Taxi provider ID

Pickup/Dropoff coordinates

Passenger count, Fare, Tips, Tolls

Target = Total Amount
